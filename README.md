# Advent of Code 2022

This is a repo with my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

I'm trying to solve them using OCaml as I'm trying to recall it after a lengthy break, so code quality may be far from perfect.
Here I'll try not to overcomplicate the process of writing and focus solely on code, so I'm not going to use any additional tools for building except for the basic `ocamlbuild` (at least for now).

Running on `Ocaml 4.12.0`.

*Happy hacking!*
